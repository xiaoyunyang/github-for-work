# github-for-work

> serverless webapp that works without Internet.

Needs to run on Internet Explorer 11.

## Built with

* [`React.js`](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases) v15.6.2
* [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/)@latest
* [jQuery V 2.2.4](https://blog.jquery.com/2016/05/20/jquery-1-12-4-and-2-2-4-released/)
  * Note, jQuery 3.0 and above doesn't work with MaterializeCSS's chip autocompleteOptions.
  * But materialize@next will not require jQuery as a dependency anymore, but it's still in alpha.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery)

* [JSXTransformer has been deprecated](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/06/12/deprecating-jstransform-and-react-tools.html), but we still need this for our app.
